        Day #8

        we could ever ask for...
        <br />
        What do they believe?
        <br />
        Where are all their fathers?
        <br />
        Where are all their mothers?
        <br />
        It's hard to reach across the
        <br />
        unbelievable distances between
        <br />
        what we really are
        <br />
        and who we claim to be.
        <br />
